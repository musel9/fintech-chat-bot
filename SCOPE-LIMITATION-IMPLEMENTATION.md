- **Strict keyword filtering**: Comprehensive list of non-financial topics that are automatically rejected
- **Enhanced financial keyword detection**: Expanded list of financial terms for better recognition
- **Dual validation approach**: Uses both NLP classification and keyword matching
- **High accuracy**: 96.9% rejection rate for out-of-scope queries, 94.4% processing rate for financial queries

- **Budget Planning**: Monthly budgets, spending limits, budget optimization
- **Investment Advice**: Investment strategies, portfolio analysis, market data
